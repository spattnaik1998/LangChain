Prompt Templates, LangChain Memory, and SimpleSequentialChain
LangChain is an open-source LLM application development framework that offers modular components for building Language Model applications efficiently. One key feature of LangChain is the use of Prompt Templates, which enable users to instruct large language models to provide specific and tailored responses. By utilizing prompt engineering techniques, users can guide language models to generate responses that align with desired contexts and queries.

LangChain provides tools for customizing conversational memory, allowing for the orchestration of long and coherent conversations between language models and users. The ConversationChain feature saves the context of each interaction in a buffer memory, ensuring that language models retain important details from previous conversations. Different memory options, such as ConversationBufferMemory and ConversationSummaryMemory, offer flexibility in managing conversation history and optimizing token usage.

LLM Chains in LangChain facilitate the chaining of multiple Language Models to add functionalities and complexity to applications. Sequential Chains and Router Chains are available for different use cases, enabling the seamless flow of inputs and outputs between language models. These chains streamline the development process by allowing for the integration of multiple models to enhance the overall application functionality.
